#### 2.1 Introduction 📸

**Key Objectives**:
- Reflect on what interaction design involves.
- Explain some of the advantages of involving a range of people as participants in the interaction design process.
- Introduce the four basic activities of interaction design and how they are related in a simple lifecycle model.
- Consider some practical questions about the interaction design process and how it fits into other development lifecycles.

**Key Ideas**:
- **People-Centered Concerns**: The goal is to design systems that prioritize the needs and experiences of people rather than just technical aspects.
- **Stakeholders and Trade-Offs**: Successful interaction design includes balancing the input from stakeholders, addressing conflicting requirements, and making informed trade-offs.

**Key Questions Raised**:
- How do we understand the needs of stakeholders?
- How can we balance design trade-offs effectively, such as user freedom versus system guidance?
- How do we generate alternatives, and how do we choose the best one?

#### 2.2 What Is Involved in Interaction Design? 💡🖊️

**The Double Diamond of Design**: 
- The **Design Council** of the UK created the **Double Diamond Model**:
  - **Discover** 🔍: Understanding the problem space and talking to those affected.
  - **Define** 📑: Defining the challenge based on insights gained.
  - **Develop** 🔧: Creating and co-designing different responses, drawing on inspirations.
  - **Deliver** 📦: Testing solutions at a small scale, rejecting or evolving based on outcomes.

**Four Design Principles**:
1. **Be People-Centered** 👥
2. **Communicate (Visually & Inclusively)** 🗣️🎨
3. **Collaborate & Co-Create** 🤝✨
4. **Iterate, Iterate, Iterate** 🔄🔄🔄

**Key Insights**:
- **Non-Linear Process**: The double diamond model shows that interaction design is iterative, where phases are repeated multiple times.
- **People-Centered Design Philosophy**: Engaging different stakeholders enhances the design process, making it more inclusive and representative of real needs.

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Maarten Houben et al. (2020)**: Conducted workshops involving diverse stakeholders for designing an interactive sound cushion, emphasizing user and stakeholder input.
- **Design Council (2019)**: "No idea is ever ‘finished’ in an ever-changing and digital world."

#### 2.3 Some Practical Issues 🔍⚙️

**Key Practical Issues to Address**:
- **How to find out what people need** 🗣️: Asking people may not always provide accurate insights since they may not know what is possible or needed.
- **Generating Alternative Designs** 💡: Using prompts and other creativity tools can help inspire designers to come up with alternatives.
- **Choosing Among Alternatives** 🔀: Making informed design decisions is crucial; each decision can impact the final product experience.

**User Involvement**:
- **Degrees of User Involvement** 👥: User involvement can range from fully engaged throughout all iterations to targeted participation in specific activities. Full-time involvement can yield deeper insights but risks detachment from the community.
- **People-Centered Approach** 🌍: Building on the early principles by **John Gould and Clayton Lewis (1985)**, user-centered design has evolved to involve more stakeholders throughout the entire process.

**Lifecycle Models**:
- **A Simple Lifecycle Model** 🚀:
  - **Discovering Requirements**: Understanding the target users and identifying how the product can be useful.
  - **Designing Alternatives**: Conceptual and concrete design steps to generate multiple alternatives.
  - **Prototyping**: Creating prototypes for usability testing.
  - **Evaluating**: Assessing prototypes to refine the final product.

**Key Attributions**:
- **Uli Abelein et al. (2013)**: Found that user involvement generally has a positive effect on user satisfaction and system use, though results vary based on involvement levels.
- **Suzanne and James Robertson (2013)**: Coined the term **“un-dreamed-of needs”**, highlighting that people may not always be aware of their own future needs.

### Summary

- 🎨 **Different design disciplines** follow different approaches, but they have commonalities that are captured in the **double diamond of design**.
- 🧠 **Understand the Problem Space**: It is important to have a good understanding of the problem space before trying to build anything.
- 🔄 The **interaction design process** consists of four basic activities: **discovering requirements** 🕵️‍♂️, **designing alternatives** ✏️, **prototyping** 🛠️, and **evaluating** 📊.
- 👥 **People-centered design** rests on three principles: **early focus on users and tasks** ⏱️, **empirical measurement** 📏, and **iterative design** 🔁. These principles are key for interaction design.
- 🤝 **Involving users and stakeholders** assists with **expectation management** 🎯 and **feelings of ownership** 🏠, but careful planning is needed for how and when to involve them.
- 🔍 Looking at **others’ designs** and **involving others** in the design process provides useful **inspiration** 💡 and encourages considering **alternative solutions** ✨, which is key to effective design.
- ⚖️ **Usability criteria**, **technical feasibility** ⚙️, and **user feedback** 💬 can all be used to **choose among alternatives**.
- 🛠️ **Prototyping** is a useful technique for **facilitating user feedback** on designs at all stages.
- 🔄 **Interaction design activities** are becoming better integrated with **lifecycle models** from other related disciplines like **software engineering** 💻.
