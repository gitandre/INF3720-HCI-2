### 3.1 Introduction 📸

- **Importance of Conceptualizing Ideas**:
  - Conceptualization helps define what a proposed product will do.
  - This can serve as a proof of concept, related to the double diamond framework phases—“discover” and “define.”

- **Reality Check for Ideas**:
  - Initial conceptualization scrutinizes ideas for feasibility.
  - It forces designers to clarify how users will understand, learn about, and interact with the product.

- **Voice-Assisted Mobile Robot Example**:
  - Designers should identify the problem being solved.
  - Example scenario: A voice-assisted mobile robot for restaurant use.
  - Initial claims focused on the robot's benefits but not on a real problem.
  - An actual problem might be difficulty in recruiting good waiters.

- **Questions to Address for Design**:
  - How intelligent must the robot be?
  - How will the robot move and interact with customers?
  - How will customers perceive the robot—fun or gimmicky?

- **Comparative Robot Design Example**:
  - Another robot server designed after the pandemic helps waiters, focusing on delivering food.
  - This robot is not human-like and acts as a tool to assist rather than replace waiters.

- **Early Ideation Considerations**:
  - Consider unknowns and show the sources of inspiration.
  - Identify relevant theories or research to support initial ideas.

- **Articulating Ideas as Concepts**:
  - Asking questions, articulating assumptions, and expressing ideas as concepts help clarify the product's design.
  - This early ideation helps in moving from vague ideas to concrete models with defined features and functionality. 

### 3.2 Conceptualizing Interaction 🎨💡

- **Identify Assumptions and Claims** 🤔
  - **Assumption**: Taking something for granted, needing investigation (e.g., people want self-driving cars).
  - **Claim**: A statement assumed true but open to question (e.g., people will feel safe in self-driving cars).
  - Assumptions focus on current situations, while claims are about potential future outcomes. 📅🔮

- **Clarify Your Design Ideas** ✍️
  - Write down and evaluate assumptions/claims.
  - Identify vague ideas to refine and strengthen them.
  - Helps improve design ideas or create new user experiences that don't yet exist. 🚀

- **Team Scenario: Improving a Browser** 📱🌐
  - The team assumes there's a usability problem since customers switched to a rival browser.
  - Claims improvement will win customers back by making the interface simpler and more attractive. 🎨✨
  - User research reveals usability problems, like difficulties with the bookmark function. 📑❌
  - Diverse perspectives help identify conflicting views and challenge vague assumptions. 🗣️🤷‍♂️

- **Example Questions to Explore Problems** ❓
  - Are there problems with the product/user experience? 🔍
  - What evidence supports these problems? 📊
  - How can the design solve these problems? 🔧

- **Lessons from 3D TV and Curved TV Failures** 📺❌
  - Assumed people would want an enhanced viewing experience akin to the cinema.
  - Reality: 3D glasses were cumbersome, and benefits of curved TVs weren’t worth the cost.
  - Highlight: Importance of understanding actual user needs vs. assumed desires. 📉👥

- **Importance of Defining Assumptions Early** ⏳
  - Clarify assumptions about problems/opportunities early and throughout the project.
  - Leads to better articulation of conceptual models that support the intended user experience. 🎯👥✨
