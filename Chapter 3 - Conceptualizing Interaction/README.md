### 3.1 Introduction üì∏

- **Importance of Conceptualizing Ideas**:
  - Conceptualization helps define what a proposed product will do.
  - This can serve as a proof of concept, related to the double diamond framework phases‚Äî‚Äúdiscover‚Äù and ‚Äúdefine.‚Äù

- **Reality Check for Ideas**:
  - Initial conceptualization scrutinizes ideas for feasibility.
  - It forces designers to clarify how users will understand, learn about, and interact with the product.

- **Voice-Assisted Mobile Robot Example**:
  - Designers should identify the problem being solved.
  - Example scenario: A voice-assisted mobile robot for restaurant use.
  - Initial claims focused on the robot's benefits but not on a real problem.
  - An actual problem might be difficulty in recruiting good waiters.

- **Questions to Address for Design**:
  - How intelligent must the robot be?
  - How will the robot move and interact with customers?
  - How will customers perceive the robot‚Äîfun or gimmicky?

- **Comparative Robot Design Example**:
  - Another robot server designed after the pandemic helps waiters, focusing on delivering food.
  - This robot is not human-like and acts as a tool to assist rather than replace waiters.

- **Early Ideation Considerations**:
  - Consider unknowns and show the sources of inspiration.
  - Identify relevant theories or research to support initial ideas.

- **Articulating Ideas as Concepts**:
  - Asking questions, articulating assumptions, and expressing ideas as concepts help clarify the product's design.
  - This early ideation helps in moving from vague ideas to concrete models with defined features and functionality.
