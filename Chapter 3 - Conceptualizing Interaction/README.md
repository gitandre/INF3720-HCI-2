### 3.1 Introduction 📸

- **Importance of Conceptualizing Ideas**:
  - Conceptualization helps define what a proposed product will do.
  - This can serve as a proof of concept, related to the double diamond framework phases—“discover” and “define.”

- **Reality Check for Ideas**:
  - Initial conceptualization scrutinizes ideas for feasibility.
  - It forces designers to clarify how users will understand, learn about, and interact with the product.

- **Voice-Assisted Mobile Robot Example**:
  - Designers should identify the problem being solved.
  - Example scenario: A voice-assisted mobile robot for restaurant use.
  - Initial claims focused on the robot's benefits but not on a real problem.
  - An actual problem might be difficulty in recruiting good waiters.

- **Questions to Address for Design**:
  - How intelligent must the robot be?
  - How will the robot move and interact with customers?
  - How will customers perceive the robot—fun or gimmicky?

- **Comparative Robot Design Example**:
  - Another robot server designed after the pandemic helps waiters, focusing on delivering food.
  - This robot is not human-like and acts as a tool to assist rather than replace waiters.

- **Early Ideation Considerations**:
  - Consider unknowns and show the sources of inspiration.
  - Identify relevant theories or research to support initial ideas.

- **Articulating Ideas as Concepts**:
  - Asking questions, articulating assumptions, and expressing ideas as concepts help clarify the product's design.
  - This early ideation helps in moving from vague ideas to concrete models with defined features and functionality. 

### 3.2 Conceptualizing Interaction 🎨💡

- **Identify Assumptions and Claims** 🤔
  - **Assumption**: Taking something for granted, needing investigation (e.g., people want self-driving cars).
  - **Claim**: A statement assumed true but open to question (e.g., people will feel safe in self-driving cars).
  - Assumptions focus on current situations, while claims are about potential future outcomes. 📅🔮

- **Clarify Your Design Ideas** ✍️
  - Write down and evaluate assumptions/claims.
  - Identify vague ideas to refine and strengthen them.
  - Helps improve design ideas or create new user experiences that don't yet exist. 🚀

- **Team Scenario: Improving a Browser** 📱🌐
  - The team assumes there's a usability problem since customers switched to a rival browser.
  - Claims improvement will win customers back by making the interface simpler and more attractive. 🎨✨
  - User research reveals usability problems, like difficulties with the bookmark function. 📑❌
  - Diverse perspectives help identify conflicting views and challenge vague assumptions. 🗣️🤷‍♂️

- **Example Questions to Explore Problems** ❓
  - Are there problems with the product/user experience? 🔍
  - What evidence supports these problems? 📊
  - How can the design solve these problems? 🔧

- **Lessons from 3D TV and Curved TV Failures** 📺❌
  - Assumed people would want an enhanced viewing experience akin to the cinema.
  - Reality: 3D glasses were cumbersome, and benefits of curved TVs weren’t worth the cost.
  - Highlight: Importance of understanding actual user needs vs. assumed desires. 📉👥

- **Importance of Defining Assumptions Early** ⏳
  - Clarify assumptions about problems/opportunities early and throughout the project.
  - Leads to better articulation of conceptual models that support the intended user experience. 🎯👥✨

  
### 3.3 Conceptual Models 🧠🔍

- **Definition of Conceptual Models** 📜
  - A **conceptual model** is a simplified description of how a system operates, providing a high-level structure of a design or interface. It helps clarify the **problem space** and articulate the design. 
  - **Jeff Johnson and Austin Henderson (2002)** defined a conceptual model as "a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates." This helps designers refine their ideas before implementing the design. 🛠️✨

- **Core Components of Conceptual Models** 🗂️
  - **Metaphors and Analogies**: Convey how to use a product (e.g., browsing and bookmarking). 📚🔖
  - **Concepts and Operations**: Describe task-domain objects and what can be done with them (e.g., saving, revisiting). 💾↩️
  - **Relationships Between Concepts**: Specify how different components relate to each other (e.g., a folder containing files). 📁🗃️
  - **Mapping Concepts to User Experience**: Defines how concepts influence user actions (e.g., revisiting a webpage using bookmarks or history lists). 🌐📑

- **Debating User Experience** 💬⚖️
  - Discussing different **metaphors** helps the design team decide the best ways to support user actions, such as browsing or categorizing content.
  - This process can involve deciding between metaphors like folders or bars for organizing information. 📂📊

- **Simple vs. Complex Models** 🌀❌
  - The **best conceptual models** are intuitive, appearing simple to users.
  - However, **upgraded applications** can become too complex when new features are repeatedly added, frustrating users who preferred older methods (e.g., changes to Facebook’s newsfeed). 🤯💬

- **Representing Conceptual Models** 🖊️🖼️
  - Can be represented as **textual descriptions or diagrams** depending on the preferred language of the team. It serves as a **blueprint** for developing more detailed designs. ✍️📝

- **Examples of Conceptual Models** 📖🖥️
  - Classic models like the **shopping cart** metaphor for online shopping help customers intuitively add items and proceed to checkout. 🛒✅
  - **Xerox Star Interface (1981)**: Developed by Xerox, introduced icons like paper, folders, and mailboxes, making complex actions understandable by relating them to physical objects. It became a foundation for today’s desktop interfaces. 📄📂🖥️

- **Classic Innovations That Changed Interaction** ✨🔄
  - **Desktop Metaphor** (Xerox, late 1970s): Made office tasks accessible and visual. 🖥️
  - **Digital Spreadsheet** (Dan Bricklin & Bob Frankston, late 1970s): Enabled flexible calculations through interactive boxes. 📊📈
  - **World Wide Web** (Tim Berners-Lee, late 1980s): Made information access universal, expanding activities like browsing, learning, and communication. 🌍💻

- **Hazlewood et al. (2010)**: Illustrated an ambient display design aimed at changing people’s behavior—like taking the stairs instead of the elevator. 🏢✨
