### 3.1 Introduction 📸

- **Importance of Conceptualizing Ideas**:
  - Conceptualization helps define what a proposed product will do.
  - This can serve as a proof of concept, related to the double diamond framework phases—“discover” and “define.”

- **Reality Check for Ideas**:
  - Initial conceptualization scrutinizes ideas for feasibility.
  - It forces designers to clarify how users will understand, learn about, and interact with the product.

- **Voice-Assisted Mobile Robot Example**:
  - Designers should identify the problem being solved.
  - Example scenario: A voice-assisted mobile robot for restaurant use.
  - Initial claims focused on the robot's benefits but not on a real problem.
  - An actual problem might be difficulty in recruiting good waiters.

- **Questions to Address for Design**:
  - How intelligent must the robot be?
  - How will the robot move and interact with customers?
  - How will customers perceive the robot—fun or gimmicky?

- **Comparative Robot Design Example**:
  - Another robot server designed after the pandemic helps waiters, focusing on delivering food.
  - This robot is not human-like and acts as a tool to assist rather than replace waiters.

- **Early Ideation Considerations**:
  - Consider unknowns and show the sources of inspiration.
  - Identify relevant theories or research to support initial ideas.

- **Articulating Ideas as Concepts**:
  - Asking questions, articulating assumptions, and expressing ideas as concepts help clarify the product's design.
  - This early ideation helps in moving from vague ideas to concrete models with defined features and functionality. 

### 3.2 Conceptualizing Interaction 🎨💡

- **Identify Assumptions and Claims** 🤔
  - **Assumption**: Taking something for granted, needing investigation (e.g., people want self-driving cars).
  - **Claim**: A statement assumed true but open to question (e.g., people will feel safe in self-driving cars).
  - Assumptions focus on current situations, while claims are about potential future outcomes. 📅🔮

- **Clarify Your Design Ideas** ✍️
  - Write down and evaluate assumptions/claims.
  - Identify vague ideas to refine and strengthen them.

   - Modern user models also focus on other aspects of behavior, such as **emotions, personality, and learning styles**. These models are used to **personalize** digital experiences, for example, suggesting movies based on users’ unique interaction preferences. 😄🎬💡

4. **Abstract from Theories** 🧠➡️🔄
   - Models are often abstracted from broader theories, offering a **more practical application** for designers. This helps in building systems that better respond to user needs and expectations. 🛠️💻

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Don Norman (1988)**: Created models based on cognitive theories, like the **seven stages of action**, to better understand how users interact with technology. 🔄🖥️

#### 3.6.6 Frameworks 🛠️📋✨

**Section 3.6.6** explores the role of **frameworks** in interaction design, helping designers shape and guide user experiences. Here's the summarized list:

1. **Purpose of Frameworks** 🧭💡
   - **Frameworks** provide designers with **guidance** on what to design or focus on. They can take the form of **steps, questions, principles, or tactics**—helping structure the design process. 🚶‍♂️💬

2. **Difference from Models** ⚖️✨
   - Unlike **models**, which describe aspects of human behavior, **frameworks** offer **practical advice** for designing user interactions and experiences. 🎨🖥️

3. **Based on Theories and Practices** 📖🤔
   - Frameworks often emerge from both **theoretical insights** (such as cognitive theories) and **real design experiences**—bridging research with hands-on user studies. 🤓✏️

4. **Scope and Application** 🌐🔍
   - Frameworks in HCI cover diverse topics such as **learning, working, socializing, and emotion**. They are also used to design **technologies** intended to evoke specific responses, like enjoyment or empathy. 🧠❤️

5. **Don Norman’s Framework** 🛠️👨‍💻
   - **Don Norman (1988)** developed a framework that describes the **relationship between designers, systems, and users**. It includes:
     - **Designer’s Model**: How the designer thinks the system should work.
     - **System Image**: How the system is represented (via interface, help, manuals).
     - **User’s Model**: How the user understands the system. 👥🔄
   - This framework highlights the importance of **closing the gap** between what the designer envisions and what the user understands—aiming for a clearer **system image**. 📊🔗

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Don Norman (1988)**: Provided a framework to bridge the gap between **designer intentions** and **user understanding**, emphasizing the need for alignment through effective **system representation**. 🏗️🖥️✨
