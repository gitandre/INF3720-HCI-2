### **Ortony, Norman, and Revelle Model of Emotional Design** 🎮🧠

The ONR model categorizes emotions into three levels of brain functioning, helping designers understand how to trigger different emotional responses in users. Each level reflects a different way the brain processes emotions and reactions, which can be used to inform product and interaction design.

![ONR model](onr_model.png)

#### **1. Visceral Level** 🧬⚡
- **Definition**: The **visceral level** represents automatic, instinctual responses that are prewired into the brain. This level focuses on rapid, almost subconscious reactions to sensory stimuli—think of it as the "gut reaction."
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Immediate Responses**: The visceral level involves very fast, reflex-like reactions to the environment.
  - **Emotional Judgments**: These reactions often classify things as safe or dangerous, pleasurable or unpleasant.
  - **Aesthetics and Appeal**: When designing for the visceral level, the goal is often to make products visually and sensorially pleasing. This might include creating products that look attractive, feel comfortable, or sound pleasant.
- **Example**:
  - Seeing a **very large hairy spider** suddenly: Many people will experience fear immediately, scream, and possibly flee—this is an automatic visceral response.
  - **Design Application**: If a product looks sleek, has aesthetically pleasing colors, or produces a calming sound, it appeals to the visceral level by creating an immediate positive impression.

#### **2. Behavioral Level** 🚴‍♂️🛠️
- **Definition**: The **behavioral level** deals with the part of the brain responsible for everyday, routine actions. It concerns how well a product functions and the ease with which people can use it.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Focus on Functionality**: It addresses usability—how simple and efficient the product is to use.
  - **Interaction and Control**: This level involves repeated and learned actions. It reflects the habits we form when interacting with products.
  - **Emotional Feedback**: Positive experiences at this level often lead to satisfaction and comfort, as people can easily accomplish their tasks.
- **Example**:
  - **Typing or Swimming**: These activities, once learned, become almost automatic. They involve learned skills that are controlled at the behavioral level.
  - **Design Application**: The **Swatch watch** uses intuitive controls and comfortable materials, making the day-to-day use of the watch enjoyable. A product that is straightforward, reliable, and allows users to perform their tasks without unnecessary difficulty is well-designed at this level.

#### **3. Reflective Level** 🧠💡
- **Definition**: The **reflective level** represents conscious thought, contemplation, and the meaning we attribute to products. It’s about what the product represents, how it aligns with our values, and how it makes us feel about ourselves.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Intellectual and Symbolic Connections**: It’s more about personal significance, meaning, and the value the user places on the product in their life.
  - **Emotional Reflection**: Reflective design involves aspects like pride in ownership, nostalgia, or cultural resonance.
  - **Status and Identity**: This level reflects how a product might symbolize something to its user—such as status, fashion, or personal values.
- **Example**:
  - **Reflecting on a Horror Movie**: During a horror film, you may consciously think about the story’s narrative structure and artistic direction, even though the visceral level has you feeling fear during a jump scare.
  - **Design Application**: A **Swatch watch** might appeal to someone’s sense of personal identity or style, conveying a sense of fashion consciousness. The reflective level is engaged when the user thinks, "This watch expresses who I am."

### **Key Takeaways for Design** 🎨🛠️🧠
- **Layered Emotional Engagement**: Effective design aims to engage all three levels to create a rich, multi-dimensional user experience. A product should:
  1. **Viscerally** attract users with appealing looks and sensory qualities.
  2. **Behaviorally** satisfy them by being intuitive and easy to use.
  3. **Reflectively** resonate with their identity and personal values.
  
- **Practical Example—Smartphone Design** 📱:
  - **Visceral Level**: Smooth and shiny body, sleek design, bright colors, and satisfying tactile buttons.
  - **Behavioral Level**: Easy to navigate user interface, responsive screen, and ergonomic design for comfortable use.
  - **Reflective Level**: Users may feel pride in owning the latest model, or a sense of belonging to a particular community (e.g., being part of the "Apple" community).

### **Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Anthony Ortony, Don Norman, & William Revelle (2005)**: The ONR model of emotional design explains emotional responses through three levels—**visceral**, **behavioral**, and **reflective**—each engaging a different part of the user’s brain.

This model provides a useful framework for thinking about **designing interactive products that cater to different aspects of the user experience**. It helps designers aim for a balance where a product is **immediately appealing**, **functionally efficient**, and **meaningful** in a personal context. 😊🎨✨

### **Platchick's Wheel of Emotions** 🎮🧠

![Platchicks Wheel of Emotions](platchicks_wheel_of_emotions.png)

### **Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions** 🎡💛💬
**Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions** is a psychological model developed by **Robert Plutchik** in 1980, designed to illustrate how human emotions are related to each other and how they vary in intensity. The wheel represents a **visual framework** that categorizes emotions, illustrating both their **interconnectedness** and **intensity levels**. It's widely used in psychology, interaction design, and user experience (UX) design to understand and map out **emotional responses**.

#### **1. Structure of the Wheel** 🌈
The wheel is circular, with different segments that categorize emotions. Each of the **eight primary emotions** is arranged around the center and expands outward to indicate varying levels of intensity. Additionally, some emotions are formed by combinations of the primary ones.

- **Primary Emotions (8 Core Emotions)**:
  1. **Joy** (yellow)
  2. **Trust** (green)
  3. **Fear** (light blue)
  4. **Surprise** (purple)
  5. **Sadness** (dark blue)
  6. **Disgust** (dark green)
  7. **Anger** (red)
  8. **Anticipation** (orange)

- **Intensity Levels**:
  - **Intensity** is represented by the **shades of color** in the wheel. The closer to the center, the more intense the emotion (e.g., **Joy** in the outer ring transitions to **Ecstasy** at the center). The further away from the center, the less intense the emotion becomes (e.g., **Serenity** is a milder version of **Joy**).
  - Each **primary emotion** can be **stronger** or **weaker** depending on the level of intensity:
    - For example, **Rage** is the strongest intensity of **Anger**, while **Annoyance** is the weakest.

#### **2. Combination of Emotions** 🌀
One of the key concepts of Plutchik’s model is that **emotions can be blended together** to create **more complex emotions**, similar to mixing colors on a palette. This ability to mix and match emotions allows us to understand how human emotional experiences are more nuanced and layered than they might initially appear.

- **Combination Emotions**:
  - **Joy + Trust** = **Love** ❤️
  - **Trust + Fear** = **Submission** 🤲
  - **Fear + Surprise** = **Awe** 😮
  - **Surprise + Sadness** = **Disappointment** 😔
  - **Sadness + Disgust** = **Remorse** 😞
  - **Disgust + Anger** = **Contempt** 😠
  - **Anger + Anticipation** = **Aggressiveness** 💢
  - **Anticipation + Joy** = **Optimism** 🌟

#### **3. Applications in Interaction and Emotional Design** 🎨🛠️
**Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions** is often used in **user experience design** and **interaction design** to understand the **emotional journey** that users might go through when using a product or interacting with an interface. By leveraging this model, designers can think about how to **elicit the right emotions** to enhance user engagement, satisfaction, or persuade them to take certain actions.

- **1. Understanding User Emotions**:
  - The wheel can help designers predict and analyze the emotions users might experience at different stages of interacting with a product. For instance, during a checkout process, users may feel **Anticipation** when entering their payment information, but they should feel **Joy** when their order is confirmed.
  
- **2. Designing for Emotional Responses**:
  - Designers can use the wheel as a **tool to curate user journeys** that intentionally trigger positive emotions, such as **Surprise** or **Joy**. For instance, including elements of surprise like gamification or hidden rewards can make the product experience more delightful.

- **3. Mood Mapping**:
  - The wheel serves as a **color palette** to represent the emotional states of users, guiding designers in choosing the right tone, aesthetics, or communication style. For example, if you want to convey **Trust**, you might want to use visuals or copy that evoke warmth and safety, aligning with the **green shades** in the wheel.

#### **4. The Emotional Spectrum** 🌌
The wheel helps categorize **emotions along a spectrum**, ranging from the most **intense** to **mild** variations of each core emotion. By using a visual representation, Plutchik illustrates that emotions are not binary (either present or absent), but instead exist on a **continuum** of varying degrees.

- **Intensity Scale**:
  - **Fear** is less intense than **Terror** but more intense than **Apprehension**.
  - **Joy** becomes **Ecstasy** at high intensity and **Serenity** at low intensity.

This spectrum helps designers decide **how strongly** they should attempt to elicit certain emotions:
- In a **hospital waiting room app**, evoking **Serenity** might be preferred to **Ecstasy**, as the former is likely to calm anxious patients.
- In a **fitness app**, the goal might be to transition users from **Anticipation** to **Excitement** as they complete challenges.

#### **5. Key Points from Plutchik’s Theory** 📘
- **Emotions are Adaptive**: Plutchik believed emotions are **adaptive mechanisms** evolved to help us survive. For example, **Fear** triggers a flight response, **Anger** may prepare an individual for a fight, and **Trust** facilitates bonding and social support.
  
- **Opposites in the Wheel**: Opposing emotions are placed across from each other in the wheel. For instance:
  - **Joy** is opposite to **Sadness**.
  - **Fear** is opposite to **Anger**.
  
  This helps us understand that certain emotions are often **incompatible**; it’s difficult to experience both **Joy** and **Sadness** simultaneously.

#### **6. Practical Examples** 💡
- **Customer Feedback Tools**: Many businesses use interfaces similar to the **HappyOrNot terminals** (which provide buttons ranging from happy to sad faces) to gather feedback from customers. Plutchik's wheel can be a **guiding principle** in choosing these emotional expressions—customers are presented with visual cues that map their emotions easily and intuitively.
  
- **Advertising Campaigns**: Marketing campaigns often use **mixed emotions** to make them more impactful. For example, **Joy** and **Anticipation** are used in festive ads to create excitement about a product, while **Fear** and **Trust** might be used in social awareness ads to raise concern but offer hope through action.

#### **7. Summary of Key Elements in Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions** 🎨
- **Eight Primary Emotions** arranged in a wheel structure.
- **Intensity of Emotions** represented by the depth of color (central = intense, peripheral = milder).
- **Combination Emotions** illustrate complex feelings created by merging primary emotions.
- **Opposites** help depict the contrast in human emotional experience.

### **Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Robert Plutchik (1980)**: Developed the **Wheel of Emotions** to illustrate how primary emotions combine and interact, explaining the **spectrum of human emotional experiences**.

**Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions** offers a **powerful tool for designers and psychologists** to understand and visualize how emotions work, how they evolve, and how they interrelate. It serves as a guide for **eliciting appropriate emotional responses** in users, helping designers craft experiences that are more engaging, satisfying, and human-centered. 😊🌟
