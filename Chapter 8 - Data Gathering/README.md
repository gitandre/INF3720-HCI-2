###  Six Key Issues for Data Gathering**

#### 1. **Setting Goals 🎯**  
   - Define clear goals to guide the data gathering, analysis, and sessions. Goals can vary from measuring a user interface's effectiveness to understanding user reactions to new technology.  
   **Quotes & Attributions**:
   - **Robson and McCartan (2016)**: Emphasize that well-defined goals determine the techniques and analysis used.
   - **Ron Kohavi et al. (2020)**: Stress the complexity of combining metrics in online experiments like A/B testing.

#### 2. **Identifying Participants 👥**  
   - Choose participants based on study goals. Techniques include probability sampling (random selection) and nonprobability sampling (e.g., convenience sampling or volunteer panels).
   **Quotes & Attributions**:
   - **Vera Toepoel (2016)**: Details various sampling methods for surveys, emphasizing their impact on generalizability.

#### 3. **Relationship with Participants 🤝**  
   - Build a professional rapport and gain informed consent. The relationship affects data reliability. Consent can be oral, written, or recorded. Rapport is key for quality data collection, especially in remote settings.
   **Quotes & Attributions**:
   - **Peter Kaulbach et al. (2021)**: Emphasize the importance of respecting sociocultural norms, like meeting community leaders before data collection.
   - **Dray and Siegel (2004)**: Mention challenges in building rapport in remote data collection.

#### 4. **Ethical Considerations of Data Collection and Storage 🛡️**  
   - Ensure participants' data is secure and anonymous. Regulations like GDPR require careful data handling and protection, with potential legal consequences for mishandling.
   **Quotes & Attributions**:
   - **GDPR Guidelines**: Highlight the need for data encryption and secure storage to protect participants.

#### 5. **Triangulation 📐**  
   - Use multiple perspectives to ensure data accuracy. This can include different data sources, researchers, theories, or methodologies.
   **Quotes & Attributions**:
   - **Denzin (2006)** and **Jupp (2006)**: Define four types of triangulation, such as data triangulation and investigator triangulation, to improve data reliability.
   - **Nan Gao et al. (2021)**: Found that physiological data and self-reported engagement may not always match, questioning the reliability of ground truth.

#### 6. **Pilot Studies 🧪**  
   - Conduct a trial run of the study to identify and correct issues before the main data collection. It helps test procedures, equipment, and even research questions.
   **Quotes & Attributions**:
   - **Omid Mohaddesi and Casper Harteveld (2020)**: Piloted their study to verify if their game-based environment was suitable for future research.

### **8.3 Capturing Data **:
#### **8.3.1 Notes Plus Photographs 📒📸**:

- **Note-taking** (handwritten or typed) is a flexible, low-tech way to capture data, helping analysts focus and reflect 📝.
- **Handwritten Notes** are less intrusive than typing, and more adaptable for things like diagrams ✍️.
- **Benefits**: Writing by hand helps researchers concentrate on important points and begin analyzing early 🔍.
- **Challenges**: Difficult to capture everything accurately, tiring, prone to biases, and can be hard to read 🌀.
- **Photographs & Videos**: These visual aids help supplement notes with more context—like snapshots of artifacts, events, or environments 📷🎥.
- **Collaboration**: Working with a colleague helps capture more perspectives and reduces note-taking fatigue 🤝.

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Sharp et al. (2022)**: Describes the benefits and challenges of using handwritten notes for data gathering and the value of adding photographs and videos for richer context.

#### **8.3.2 Audio Plus Photographs 🎤📸**:

- **Audio Recording** is a helpful alternative to note-taking, less intrusive than video, and lets observers focus on the activity rather than jotting down everything 🗣️.
- **Interview Advantage**: Allows the interviewer to focus on the interviewee, improving the quality of the interaction 🤝.
- **Selective Transcription**: Usually, only important parts are transcribed based on study goals. Full transcription isn’t always necessary ✍️.
- **Memory Aid**: Recordings evoke vivid memories of the session, providing richer context during analysis 🧠.
- **Quality Matters**: Good audio quality is crucial—positioning the recording device well and avoiding loud noises is key 🎙️.
- **Tools & Tech**: Platforms like Zoom and Teams allow direct recording, sometimes with automated transcription, reducing the burden of manual transcription 💻📝.
- **Accuracy Issues**: Automated transcriptions are around 80-90% accurate, affected by noise and clarity of speech 🔊.
- **Visual Aid**: Audio recordings are often paired with photographs to provide more complete context 📷.

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Sharp et al. (2022)**: Highlighted the benefits of using audio recordings combined with photographs for enhancing the quality of data gathering and reducing the workload of note-taking.

#### **8.3.3 Video 🎥**:

- **Video Recording**: Smartphones can collect short video clips; ideal for capturing rich context quickly 📱.
- **Long-term Needs**: For long recordings (e.g., in labs or hospitals), dedicated cameras are often better for stability and coverage 🔄.
- **Camera Types**:
  - **Wearable Cameras**: Capture from a participant’s point of view, great for immersive experiences 🏃‍♂️👀.
  - **360-Degree Cameras**: Capture full context, providing a comprehensive overview of the activity 🌐.
- **Fixed vs. Flexible Settings**:
  - **Fixed Cameras**: Stay in one place, ideal for consistent angles 🗺️.
  - **Flexible Cameras**: Allow zooming and focusing; useful if researchers need control over the recording remotely or onsite 🔍.
- **Camera Placement**: Crucial for capturing relevant action. Plan in advance, and familiarize with the environment to find the best locations 🗺️📌.
- **Participant Involvement**: Involve participants in deciding what and where to record; especially important in private settings (e.g., home) 🏠🤝.
- **Impact on Participants**: Video might affect behavior; researchers should empirically assess whether recording influences actions (e.g., participants being camera-conscious) 📹👀.

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Nassauer and Legewie (2022); Heath et al. (2010)**: Discussed considerations for choosing cameras, placement, and settings, emphasizing the importance of understanding context and participant behavior during video recording.
