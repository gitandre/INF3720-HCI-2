#### 1.1 Introduction 📝

**Definitions**:
- **Interaction Design (IxD)**: Designing interactive products that aim to make the user experience easy, effective, and enjoyable.
- **User Experience (UX) Design**: Focuses on optimizing the user’s overall experience while interacting with a product or service.
- **People-Centered Design**: Focuses on a broader approach that goes beyond individual users, addressing groups, societies, and their interactions with technology.
- **Customer Experience (CX)**: Covers the total experience a person has with a product, including brand engagement, and the likelihood to recommend it (Lowden, 2014).

**Key Attributions**:
- **Alan Cooper (2018)**: Criticized the failure of many modern products to apply basic interaction design principles, labeling it as "inexplicable and unforgivable."
- **Don Norman (2018)**: Advocated for shifting the language from "user" to "people" to emphasize broader impact.

**Key Lists**:
- **Usability Goals** (e.g., effectiveness, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability, memorability).
- **Design Principles** (e.g., visibility, feedback, constraints, consistency, affordance).

#### 1.2 Good and Poor Design 👍👎

**Concepts of Good and Poor Design**:
- **Good Design**: Interactive products that are easy, enjoyable, and efficient. For example, using a smartphone or tablet, where swiping through photos feels natural and satisfying.
- **Poor Design**: Products that are confusing or frustrating, often due to a lack of clear guidance or feedback. An example is setting the time on a stove, which can be unintuitive due to non-obvious button combinations.

**Alan Cooper’s Perspective**:
- **Alan Cooper (2018)**: Critiques the continued existence of poor design in software products, stating many still do not offer basic features like "undo." This suggests that even modern software lacks essential interaction design principles.

#### 1.6 People-Centered Design 👥❤️

**Don Norman’s Proposal**:
- **Don Norman (2018)**: Advocates for the use of "people-centered design," which emphasizes designing with the broader implications for groups and societies in mind rather than focusing solely on individual users.

**Terminology Debate**:
- **User vs. People vs. Customer**: The choice of terminology should match the context:
  - **User** is appropriate for specific technological interactions.
  - **People** is broader, suitable for social or community impacts.
  - **Customer** encompasses the entire customer journey and overall experience.

---

#### 1.7 Understanding People 🧠👥

**Key Considerations**:
- Interaction design requires a deep understanding of people’s needs, abilities, and preferences.
- Focus on how individuals think, perceive, and use products.
- Understanding these aspects can help to design products that are intuitive and effective.

---

#### 1.8 Accessibility and Inclusiveness ♿🤲

**Key Principles**:
- Design should accommodate users with different abilities and backgrounds.
- **Accessibility**: Products should be usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.
- **Inclusiveness**: Considering diverse user groups to ensure that products are beneficial to a wide range of people.
  
**Goals**:
- **Inclusiveness**: Design should ensure products are accessible to everyone, regardless of physical, sensory, or cognitive capabilities.

**User Experience (UX) Goals**:
- Focus on the overall **user satisfaction** and the **emotional** aspect of the interaction.
- Emphasis on **positive emotions** like enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction while avoiding negative experiences like frustration or confusion.

### Design Principles (to achieve Usability and UX goals):

- 🔍 **Visibility**: Users should easily understand what actions they can take.
- 🔔 **Feedback**: The system should give immediate responses to user actions.
- 🚧 **Constraints**: Limit user interactions to prevent errors.
- 🔄 **Consistency**: Ensures that similar actions have similar results across the system.
- 🖲️ **Affordance**: Elements should suggest their use (e.g., buttons look clickable).
