### **5.2 Being Social** 👥🌐📱

**Key Points & Attributions**:

- **Importance of Social Interaction** 🤝:
  - Socializing is a fundamental part of life, including sharing news, updates, and events—whether it’s at work, home, or with friends and family.

- **Shift to Online Communication** 💬📲:
  - Social media usage has dramatically increased, with many hours spent messaging, tweeting, and videoconferencing.
  - Workplace communication tools like WhatsApp, Slack, and Teams have become standard.

- **Impact of Social Media on Connections** 🌍🔗:
  - Before COVID-19, the rise of social media saw people having large online networks (e.g., 300+ Facebook friends or 1,000+ LinkedIn connections).
  - Social computing tools like shared calendars (e.g., Google Docs, Miro) have also transformed how we connect.

- **COVID-19 and Social Distancing** 🦠🏠:
  - The pandemic led to a huge increase in the use of videoconferencing tools like Zoom and Teams for work, study, and socializing.
  - Social bubbles were introduced, with schools, universities, and households adapting to limit physical contact.

- **Hybrid Working After the Pandemic** 💻🏢:
  - Hybrid models became more common, but remote participants often had a less immersive experience compared to those in person.
  - Issues included tech setup problems, and challenges in making hybrid meetings as engaging as in-person ones.

- **Zoom Parties and Social Adaptations** 🎉🖥️:
  - During the pandemic, "Zoom parties" became a social phenomenon—people would chat, play games, and celebrate together online.
  - **Yvonne Rogers (2020)**: Shared personal experiences of Zoom birthday celebrations and the challenges of missing in-person connections.

- **Concerns About Screen Time** 📱⌛:
  - Growing concerns around the impact of screen time on well-being. Surveys show people spend 5-6 hours a day on their phones (Ceci, 2022).
  - **Sherry Turkle (2015)**: Warns of the negative impact on conversations and empathy due to increased online communication—urging people to "reclaim conversation."

- **Yvonne Rogers (2020)**: Documented the emergence of Zoom parties and the longing for physical connection during the pandemic.

### **5.3 Face-to-Face Conversations** 🗣️👥🎶

**Key Points & Attributions**:

- **Conversations as Collaborative Achievement** 🤝🎵:
  - Holding a conversation is a skilled collaboration, like a musical ensemble. Understanding how conversations progress helps in designing better chatbot dialogues and voice assistants.

- **Conversation Starters & Enders** 📞👋:
  - Conversations often begin with mutual greetings ("Hi!" 👋) and end with farewell rituals ("Goodbye!" 👋). Implicit cues like checking the time also signal the end of a conversation.

- **Phone vs. Online Conversations** ☎️💻:
  - Phone calls often start with a greeting ("Hello, John!") and end with formal farewells, while online chats often skip these and go straight to the point.

- **Email Study on Replies** 📧💬:
  - **Brendan (2017)**: Analyzed 300,000 emails. Casual openings like "Hey" and endings with "Thanks" received higher reply rates compared to formal phrases.

- **Turn-Taking Rules** 🔄🗣️:
  - **Sacks et al. (1978)**: Defined three turn-taking rules:
    1. Speaker chooses next person.
    2. Someone else decides to speak.
    3. Speaker continues if no one else speaks.

- **Cues for Turn-Taking** ✋👀:
  - Signals include lowering/raising voice, body language, back-channeling (e.g., "uh-huh"), and gestures like raising hands.

- **Adjacency Pairs for Coherence** 👥➡️👥:
  - **Schegloff and Sacks (1973)**: Conversations often occur in pairs (e.g., Question ➡️ Response) to maintain coherence.

- **Conversation Breakdowns & Repairs** 🛠️🤷‍♀️:
  - Breakdowns happen when misunderstandings arise. Repair mechanisms like repeating louder or using gestures help correct these misunderstandings.

- **Nonverbal Communication** 🖐️👀:
  - Nonverbal cues (gestures, facial expressions, voice intonation) are key in face-to-face interactions to signal meaning beyond words.

- **Chatbots and Turn-Taking** 🤖🔄:
  - Conversational interfaces like **Replika** mimic human conversation by encouraging turn-taking. Chatbots are evolving to mediate work meetings and steer conversations effectively (Reicherts et al., 2022).

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Brendan (2017)**: Casual greetings like "Hey" and ending with "Thanks" led to higher reply rates in email conversations.
- **Sacks et al. (1978)**: Defined key rules for managing turn-taking in conversations.
- **Schegloff and Sacks (1973)**: Discussed the use of adjacency pairs to maintain conversation flow.

### 5.4 Remote Collaboration and Communication

#### **5.4.1 Videoconferencing** 📹💻🤝

**Key Points & Attributions**:

- **Early Videoconferencing Research** 📽️🕰️:
  - **Fish et al. (1990)**: Created the **VideoWindow**, a system that connected two distant lounges with large video projections, making conversations feel almost face-to-face.
  - Users spoke a bit louder and discussed the video system often during these early tests (Kraut et al., 1990).

- **Characteristics of Videoconferencing Behavior** 📞🗣️:
  - **Connaill et al. (1993)**: Found that during video calls, people projected themselves more, took longer turns, and interrupted each other less compared to in-person talks.

- **Modern Videoconferencing Tools** 🖥️🛠️:
  - Videoconferencing evolved significantly—Skype, FaceTime, Zoom, and Teams became popular, providing additional features like screen sharing, breakout rooms, custom backgrounds, and emoji reactions.

- **Zoom Fatigue** 😫💤:
  - **Bailenson (2021)**: Highlighted reasons for "Zoom fatigue," such as prolonged close-up eye contact, cognitive overload, self-evaluation from seeing oneself, and sitting in one place for too long.

- **New Virtual Spaces for Engagement** 🕹️👾:
  - During the pandemic, 2D virtual spaces like **Gather** allowed students to socialize more informally, creating avatars and moving in retro-style virtual areas to engage with others.
  - **Sococo** provided a similar experience, helping remote teams feel connected throughout the day (Kate Jones, UCL).

- **Concept of Social Translucence** 🌫️👥:
  - **Erickson and Kellogg (2000)**: Emphasized the importance of making participants and their activities visible to each other in virtual spaces, a principle integrated into tools like **Babble** and **Sococo**.

- **360 Cameras for Hybrid Meetings** 📸🔄:
  - Tools like **Meeting Owl** provided 360-degree views of meeting rooms, automatically zooming in on speakers to improve inclusivity for remote participants.

- **Hybrid Working** 🏠🏢⚖️:
  - After the pandemic, hybrid working became popular due to its flexibility—people saved time on commutes and worked more comfortably. However, remote participants often felt disconnected from office life.
  - **Microsoft (2022)**: Conducted research to make hybrid meetings more inclusive, experimenting with video feed placements to improve eye contact and shared document interactions.

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Bailenson (2021)**: Explained causes of "Zoom fatigue," including cognitive overload and prolonged eye contact.
- **Erickson and Kellogg (2000)**: Developed the principle of "social translucence" to ensure participants in virtual spaces were visible and their engagement apparent.
