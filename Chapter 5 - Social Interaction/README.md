### **5.2 Being Social** 👥🌐📱

**Key Points & Attributions**:

- **Importance of Social Interaction** 🤝:
  - Socializing is a fundamental part of life, including sharing news, updates, and events—whether it’s at work, home, or with friends and family.

  - Workplace communication tools like WhatsApp, Slack, and Teams have become standard.

- **Impact of Social Media on Connections** 🌍🔗:
  - Before COVID-19, the rise of social media saw people having large online networks (e.g., 300+ Facebook friends or 1,000+ LinkedIn connections).
  - Social computing tools like shared calendars (e.g., Google Docs, Miro) have also transformed how we connect.

- **COVID-19 and Social Distancing** 🦠🏠:
  - The pandemic led to a huge increase in the use of videoconferencing tools like Zoom and Teams for work, study, and socializing.
  - Social bubbles were introduced, with schools, universities, and households adapting to limit physical contact.

- **Hybrid Working After the Pandemic** 💻🏢:
  - Hybrid models became more common, but remote participants often had a less immersive experience compared to those in person.
  - Issues included tech setup problems, and challenges in making hybrid meetings as engaging as in-person ones.

- **Zoom Parties and Social Adaptations** 🎉🖥️:
  - During the pandemic, "Zoom parties" became a social phenomenon—people would chat, play games, and celebrate together online.
