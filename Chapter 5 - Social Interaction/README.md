  - Social computing tools like shared calendars (e.g., Google Docs, Miro) have also transformed how we connect.

- **COVID-19 and Social Distancing** 🦠🏠:
  - The pandemic led to a huge increase in the use of videoconferencing tools like Zoom and Teams for work, study, and socializing.
  - Social bubbles were introduced, with schools, universities, and households adapting to limit physical contact.

- **Hybrid Working After the Pandemic** 💻🏢:
  - Hybrid models became more common, but remote participants often had a less immersive experience compared to those in person.
  - Issues included tech setup problems, and challenges in making hybrid meetings as engaging as in-person ones.

- **Social Presence vs. Telepresence** 👥💬:
  - **Short et al. (1976)**: Described "social presence" as the feeling of being with a real person virtually. It's different from telepresence, which involves a virtual person in a physical space.

- **3D Virtual Worlds for Socializing** 🌍💃:
  - Virtual spaces, like the **2020 ISMAR Conference**, used 3D environments to connect attendees. Avatars could perform actions like dancing and clapping, enhancing the feeling of social presence, but still fell short of true realism.

- **The Metaverse** 🕶️🌌:
  - The Metaverse aims to create a richer, immersive experience where digital avatars interact in 3D worlds.
  - **Mark Zuckerberg (Meta)**: Envisioned a more embodied experience using VR controllers to enhance the sense of presence. Current limitations include the absence of legs in avatars due to tracking challenges.

**Quotes & Attributions**:

- **Shared Calendars** 🗓️📆:
  - Tools like Google and Outlook calendars help people manage meetings and events. They are used both at work and at home to coordinate schedules, especially for family activities (birthdays, playdates, etc.).

- **Miro for Online Learning** 🎨📚:
  - **Nic Marquardt (UCL)**: Uses Miro for teaching interaction design. Students upload their design posters on the digital canvas, where others can zoom in, comment, and give feedback using digital sticky notes (yellow for students, orange for instructors).

- **Live Sessions with Miro** 🖱️✨:
  - During live classes, students move their cursors around the Miro board, which helps create a sense of shared space. Students enjoyed the visibility of activities and the collaborative nature of feedback.

- **People-in-a-Box** 📦👤:
  - **Proto (David Nussbaum, 2020)**: Developed a 3D box to display lifelike digital images of people. The 3D "people-in-a-box" provide an almost real-time interaction experience using embedded LEDs that create volumetric depth.
