### **5.2 Being Social** 👥🌐📱

**Key Points & Attributions**:

- **Importance of Social Interaction** 🤝:
  - Socializing is a fundamental part of life, including sharing news, updates, and events—whether it’s at work, home, or with friends and family.

- **Shift to Online Communication** 💬📲:
  - Social media usage has dramatically increased, with many hours spent messaging, tweeting, and videoconferencing.
  - Workplace communication tools like WhatsApp, Slack, and Teams have become standard.

- **Impact of Social Media on Connections** 🌍🔗:
  - Before COVID-19, the rise of social media saw people having large online networks (e.g., 300+ Facebook friends or 1,000+ LinkedIn connections).
  - Social computing tools like shared calendars (e.g., Google Docs, Miro) have also transformed how we connect.

- **COVID-19 and Social Distancing** 🦠🏠:
  - The pandemic led to a huge increase in the use of videoconferencing tools like Zoom and Teams for work, study, and socializing.
  - Social bubbles were introduced, with schools, universities, and households adapting to limit physical contact.

- **Hybrid Working After the Pandemic** 💻🏢:
  - Hybrid models became more common, but remote participants often had a less immersive experience compared to those in person.
  - Issues included tech setup problems, and challenges in making hybrid meetings as engaging as in-person ones.

- **Zoom Parties and Social Adaptations** 🎉🖥️:
  - During the pandemic, "Zoom parties" became a social phenomenon—people would chat, play games, and celebrate together online.
  - **Yvonne Rogers (2020)**: Shared personal experiences of Zoom birthday celebrations and the challenges of missing in-person connections.

- **Concerns About Screen Time** 📱⌛:
  - Growing concerns around the impact of screen time on well-being. Surveys show people spend 5-6 hours a day on their phones (Ceci, 2022).
  - **Sherry Turkle (2015)**: Warns of the negative impact on conversations and empathy due to increased online communication—urging people to "reclaim conversation."

- **Technologies Promoting Social Interaction** 🗣️🔊:
  - Voice assistants like Amazon Echo provide interactive experiences for families (e.g., "Open the Magic Door"), encouraging joint use in shared spaces.

- **Changing Social Norms** 🛑🙋‍♀️:
  - Social etiquette adapted during videoconferencing, like muting oneself or using emoji reactions (e.g., raising a virtual hand or clicking emoji like hearts ❤️).

- **Social Activity Planning** 📅🤔:
  - A shift from phone calls to WhatsApp groups for planning events, but often leads to delays and miscommunication. Teens particularly wait till the last moment for better social offers, making pre-planning challenging.

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Sherry Turkle (2015)**: "It is time to reclaim conversation... to put down our phones more often and (re)learn the art of talking to each other."
- **Yvonne Rogers (2020)**: Documented the emergence of Zoom parties and the longing for physical connection during the pandemic.


### **5.3 Face-to-Face Conversations** 🗣️👥🎶

**Key Points & Attributions**:

- **Conversations as Collaborative Achievement** 🤝🎵:
  - Holding a conversation is a skilled collaboration, like a musical ensemble. Understanding how conversations progress helps in designing better chatbot dialogues and voice assistants.

- **Conversation Starters & Enders** 📞👋:
  - Conversations often begin with mutual greetings ("Hi!" 👋) and end with farewell rituals ("Goodbye!" 👋). Implicit cues like checking the time also signal the end of a conversation.

- **Phone vs. Online Conversations** ☎️💻:
  - Phone calls often start with a greeting ("Hello, John!") and end with formal farewells, while online chats often skip these and go straight to the point.

- **Email Study on Replies** 📧💬:
  - **Brendan (2017)**: Analyzed 300,000 emails. Casual openings like "Hey" and endings with "Thanks" received higher reply rates compared to formal phrases.

- **Turn-Taking Rules** 🔄🗣️:
  - **Sacks et al. (1978)**: Defined three turn-taking rules:
    1. Speaker chooses next person.
    2. Someone else decides to speak.
    3. Speaker continues if no one else speaks.

- **Cues for Turn-Taking** ✋👀:
  - Signals include lowering/raising voice, body language, back-channeling (e.g., "uh-huh"), and gestures like raising hands.

- **Adjacency Pairs for Coherence** 👥➡️👥:
  - **Schegloff and Sacks (1973)**: Conversations often occur in pairs (e.g., Question ➡️ Response) to maintain coherence.

- **Conversation Breakdowns & Repairs** 🛠️🤷‍♀️:
  - Breakdowns happen when misunderstandings arise. Repair mechanisms like repeating louder or using gestures help correct these misunderstandings.

- **Nonverbal Communication** 🖐️👀:
  - Nonverbal cues (gestures, facial expressions, voice intonation) are key in face-to-face interactions to signal meaning beyond words.

- **Chatbots and Turn-Taking** 🤖🔄:
  - Conversational interfaces like **Replika** mimic human conversation by encouraging turn-taking. Chatbots are evolving to mediate work meetings and steer conversations effectively (Reicherts et al., 2022).

**Quotes & Attributions**:
- **Brendan (2017)**: Casual greetings like "Hey" and ending with "Thanks" led to higher reply rates in email conversations.
- **Sacks et al. (1978)**: Defined key rules for managing turn-taking in conversations.
- **Schegloff and Sacks (1973)**: Discussed the use of adjacency pairs to maintain conversation flow.
